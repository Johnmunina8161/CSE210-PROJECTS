/*
I will be writting an open-ended project that will be about foods delivery designed to provide a menu system where users can choose activities such as placing an order, 
tracking an order, or canceling an order. 
Each activity is implemented as a separate class inheriting from a base class called DeliveryActivity, 
which contains common attributes and behaviors. 
The program follows the principles of encapsulation 
and abstraction by using private member variables and organizing related items in separate classes. 
It also incorporates pauses and animations to provide a more interactive experience for the user. 
Overall, the program allows users to interact with a simplified food delivery system 
and demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in C#.
