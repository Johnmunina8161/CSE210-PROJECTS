/*

The program demonstrates the concept of 
polymorphism. It defines a hierarchy of activity types (Running, Cycling, and Swimming) 
that inherit from a base class called Activity, 
and allows different activity types to share a common interface (Activity) 
while providing specialized behavior through method overriding.
